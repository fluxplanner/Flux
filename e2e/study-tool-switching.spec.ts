/*
 * Switching tools inside a Study Tools subject, while the cloud pull is running.
 *
 * The bug: fluxStudyHub.applyFromCloud() assigned subject/chemTab/tool straight
 * from the pulled record, and that pull fires every 8 seconds. Those three
 * fields are a cursor — where the student is looking this second — not data, so
 * taking them mid-use produced "I click Matrix and it just doesn't work" twice
 * over:
 *
 *   · The pull landing in the one-frame gap the click handler leaves between
 *     writing state.tool and rendering reverted the selection, so the tab you
 *     clicked lit up and the panel redrew the tool the cloud named. Measured
 *     before the fix: active tab "Matrix", panel "Graphing calculator",
 *     state.tool.math back to "graph".
 *   · The pull moving state.subject left the strip on screen but every click on
 *     it filed under the wrong subject — state.tool.chemistry = 'matrix' — and
 *     renderToolBody found no such tool, returned false, and changed nothing.
 *     From then on every tab on that strip was dead.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted, because over-guarding is its own bug: if the
 * cursor stopped being adopted at sign-in the student would land on Chemistry
 * every time, which looks nothing like this and would go unnoticed.
