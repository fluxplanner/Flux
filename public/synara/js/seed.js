/* ============================================================
   seed.js — demo data
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Called by main.js on first run (and by "Reset demo data").

   Two rules this file follows:

   1. EVERYTHING IS SYNTHETIC. Invented names, 555 phone numbers
      (reserved for fiction), a made-up school. No real person's
      health information is in this repo, which is what makes it
      safe to deploy publicly.

   2. THE CORRELATIONS ARE REAL. The insight engine computes from
      whatever is logged — it is not fed conclusions. So the seed
      plants genuine structure (seizures clustering after missed
      evening doses and short-sleep nights) and lets the engine
      find it. If you change the numbers below, the Patterns screen
      changes with them. That honesty is the point of the demo.

   Everything is generated relative to today, so the app never looks
   stale no matter when it is opened.

/* Offsets in days back from today. Three of the four seizures come
   less than 48h after a missed evening dose — deliberately not all
   four. The one at day 38 was triggered by strobe lighting with a
   clean dose record around it, so the engine reports 3/4 rather than
   a suspiciously tidy 100%. Real correlations have exceptions; a demo
   without them is a lie. All four follow a short-sleep night.

   Lapses away from the seizures stay rare (two late days, both
   recent, so dose consistency visibly slips). The engine only reports
   the dose pattern when it beats chance: with a lapse every few days,
   most 48-hour stretches hold one, 3 of 4 proves nothing, and it
